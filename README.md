# Etch A Sketch

This is an Etch A sketch site that helps users sketch by hovering their mouse pointer over grid squares which then changes the grid square's background color, tracking the trajectory of their mouse pointer over the grid. This project is part of T.O.P curriculum to help demonstrate my javascript skills, research skills and problem solving skills too.

## Learning Outcomes

- Use JS to make grid dynamically as required by the user.

- Set up event listeners and handlers to enable interactivity.

- Reference DOM elements in JS.

- Set random colors upon hovering on squares on div.

- Produce progressive darkening effect upon hovering on squares and total darkness on 10th square hovered upon.

## How To Use

- Go to [link](https://sologudlyf.github.io/etch-a-sketch/) to view the website

- A 16x16 grid is automatically set up initially, you can start sketching by hovering your mouse pointer over the squares.

- To change the grid size, click the "Set Grid Size" button, directly above the sketching area. This brings up a prompt asking you to specify one side of the grid e.g After clicking the button and entering 50 then clicking "OK" or pressing the enter key. This sets up a 50x50 grid.

- Users can set up to 100x100 grid. This has been done for performance reasons.

- Happy Sketching ðŸ˜Š!!
